            <h4>Geography</h4>
            Richland is located in the southeastern portion of Washington State. The Columbia and Yakima Rivers 
            flow and intersect near to the city. Richland is part of The Tri-Cities, which also includes Kennewick 
            and Pasco.<br>

            <h4>History</h4>
            The city was a small farming town during its first three decades as an incorporated city. During World 
            War II, the army purchased 640 square miles, which is about fifty percent the size of Rhode Island. This 
            land was purchased along the Columbia River. The U.S. Government evicted several hundred Richland 
            citizens from their homes, as well as all members from the cities of Hanford and White Bluffs. The newly 
            purchased land was used for workers on the Manhattan Project.<br>
