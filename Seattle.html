            <h4>Geography</h4>
            Like Olympia, Seattle is located off the shores of Puget Sound. Seattle is approximately sixty miles 
            northeast of Olympia. Seattle is a major urban area, surrounded by other major cities. The Cascade 
            Range and Olympic Peninsula encompass the city. <br>

            <h4>Seattle</h4>
            The city of Seattle was first settled on November 13, 1851. The name came from a Native American 
            Leader named Seattle. Chief Seattle was the leader of the Suquamish and Duwamish tribes, as well as 
            other Puget Sound tribes. <br>
